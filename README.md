# Timestamp Microservice


This project was done as a part of Backend development and APIs course on Freecodecamp and is a exact replica of [https://timestamp-microservice.freecodecamp.rocks/](https://timestamp-microservice.freecodecamp.rocks/). 

There will be examples on the site on how to use the api. You can insert other dates at the end of the http string. You will get the date in milliseconds since Jan 1, 1970 00:00:00 GMT and also the date in UTC. You can pass values as a date or milliseconds or date strings.

The project is hosted on replit: [https://timestamp-microservice-api-freecodecampproject.sathishkannan16.repl.co/](https://timestamp-microservice-api-freecodecampproject.sathishkannan16.repl.co/).
